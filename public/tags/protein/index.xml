      <description>Profinling is the action of summarizing a set of data in a smaller mathematical model. One of the practical usages of profiling techniques is the classification of sequences. With a data set profile, you may calculate the distance of an instance to the model, and classify the instance trough this value.
Profiling proteins is a more specific case of profiling sequences. As we know from the previous post about Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) is a very robust mathematical model to represent probabilistically sequences.</description>
