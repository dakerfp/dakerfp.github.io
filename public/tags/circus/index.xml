&lt;p&gt;It was a great to see again some friends from KDE Brazil and met some
new ones. The Konqui&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://dakerfp.github.io/img/kdenofisl.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also gave some talks and workshop about Qt, KDE and game development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;workshop-developing-applications-for-multiple-devices-using-plasma-technologies&#34;&gt;Workshop: Developing applications for multiple devices using Plasma technologies&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This workshop was idealized and given by &lt;a href=&#34;http://vizzion.org&#34;&gt;Sebas&lt;/a&gt;,
and I was there to help him. In the workshop, QML was introduced
together with KDE libs and what they can add to the applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Was good to show the current state of the Plasmate and how easily is
creating and deploying a new Plasmoid. It was interesting to see how
people were amazed about how easy is to start hacking and deploying a
project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;talk-games-with-qt&#34;&gt;Talk: Games with Qt&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk I gave an overview about what Qt is and which tool are
available for creating games with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;workshop-games-with-qt&#34;&gt;Workshop: Games with Qt&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the third day I gave a 3 hours hands-on workshop about game
development using only QtQuick. During the workshop, I&amp;rsquo;ve presented
basic QtQuick and some basic game concepts such as the game loop,
collisions and physics. I also tried to apply to explain how these
concepts match with the QML development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I created a simple click game
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/dakerfp/Monera-Game&#34;&gt;Monera&lt;/a&gt; as an example to the
attendees. The code was written step by step and used itself as example
and introduction to QtQuick. It was possible for everyone to write the
code on their own computers and test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end also gave them a overview about how to install the QML-Box2D
and how to use it&amp;rsquo;s API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The code used as case is available on GitHub:
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/dakerfp/Monera-Game&#34;&gt;https://github.com/dakerfp/Monera-Game&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately I didn&amp;rsquo;t used git to keep the history of steps,
modularization and refactoring I did during the workshop. I think that
would be a plus to understand the code and how we came to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was my first time on FISL and it was great! And I expect that won&amp;rsquo;t
be my last.&lt;/p&gt;
