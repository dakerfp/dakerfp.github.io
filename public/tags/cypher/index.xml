      <description>As a cryptography course project, me and @laisandrade developed a twitter extension which allows us to tweet in a way that only a group of followers can decrypt and understand my tweet. The goal is to secure broadcasting tweets to a group of followers and avoid anyone else to understand it&amp;rsquo;s content. This definition of security is safe against an eavesdropping attack, which is commonly considered secure for cryptography, what is not true.</description>
