      <description>QtQuick uses QML, a powerful tool for creating fluid interfaces in a clean, easy and fast way. It uses a declarative language (Javascript based) and it has a really good performance, which makes it suitable to make apps for any kind of platform. It&amp;rsquo;s also really easy to extend QML with Qt/C++, enbling developers to speedup the application logic or something else needed. Is also possible to use OpenGL to render QtQuick without any change in the code, sending the painting job to the video card.</description>

      <description>Today I had the honor to make a presentation with Brunno Gommes (@brunnogomes) about MongoDB on a Workshop (actually the second) of Free Software at CIn-UFPE. The workshop was organized by the University Linux User Group (CIn-LUG).
The content of the presentation was to introduce people to MongoDB basic operations and give a snapshot of the advanced features. To those who don&amp;rsquo;t know MongoDB I strongly recommend to start to reading the presentation.</description>
