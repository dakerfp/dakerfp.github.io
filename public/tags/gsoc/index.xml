      <description>

&lt;p&gt;This last month I&amp;rsquo;ve been working slowly on my GSoC project due to the
university activities (due to Brazilian academic calendar). And my
thesis, which I shall talk in other post. But at least now I&amp;rsquo;m
undergraduated!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I explained in my last post aboutÂ [Plasma Components],
my GSoC project. I&amp;rsquo;m building graphics components for developers to
build plasmoids in QML using non trivial common components such as
Sliders, ScrollBars and RadioButtons. After the break I&amp;rsquo;ve done these
components following the &lt;a href=&#34;http://bugreports.qt.nokia.com/browse/QTCOMPONENTS-200&#34;&gt;Qt Components common
API&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Switch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ButtonRow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ButtonColumn&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ScrollBar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ScrollDecorator&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keyboard event handling and focus policy for the new and old components
were added in this sprint. I also spent a lot of time refactoring some
components. I think their code is much better now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m also adding more complex use cases at the components gallery (at
kde-runtime/plasma/declarativeimports/test/gallery). By the way, this is
screenshot of the new gallery:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;![](/img/gsoc-gallery.png]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;plasma-components-gallery&#34;&gt;Plasma Components Gallery&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of the work was just straightforward, but there are some doubts I
would like to ask which you think is the best, because some of the
components behaviour are not defined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Should ScrollDecorator appear only when it&amp;rsquo;s flickableItem is
flicked, like in the mobile use case?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ScrollDecorator must should look like ScrollBar or have it&amp;rsquo;s own
appearence?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are no SVG graphics for CheckBox, RadioButton and Switch.
Currently there are placeholders. What can I do?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Currently, when you click a component, it gains the focus. This
logic must be in the components as it is? Or should left it external
to the button.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Qt Components doesn&amp;rsquo;t define any enabled property, for any
components. I think it&amp;rsquo;s important to have such a property in all
interactive components. What do you think about it?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any suggestion is highly appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I expect to give other update as soon as I have something more to
report.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Plasma Components</title>
      <link>https://dakerfp.github.io/post/plasma-components/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will talk about my GSoC project (\m/), the plasma components.
As you may know, QML is a declarative language to build rich interfaces
introduced in Qt 4.7 by providing simple primitives. As it is a powerful
way to develop interfaces and it&amp;rsquo;s the future of UI development for Qt
was necessary to make the plasma support it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create interfaces in QML is really easy and fast but sometimes we need
common widgets and may be boring to reimplement and replicate them in
every application we create (e.g. Button, Slider, ScrollBar). For avoid
this code replication, the Qt Components project was created to unify an
API for a set of components.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current (often updated) defined components and it&amp;rsquo;s API can be
found at
&lt;a href=&#34;http://bugreports.qt.nokia.com/browse/QTCOMPONENTS-200&#34;&gt;QTCOMPONENTS-200&lt;/a&gt;.
The Qt Components intends to be a cross platform, but sometimes we need
to have a closer integration of the component and the platform. In
plasma desktop we want to show tooltips or use the theme svg images for
example. The common API defines a set of properties a component must
have, but doesn&amp;rsquo;t disallow to have extra properties and functionalities
(suggestions ?). Creating the plasma components with the theme
integration and adding plasma behaviour is what my GSoC project is about
:-).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I already started working on the plasma components. They can be found
in the kde-runtime repository at the plasma/declarative branch. And more
speciffically in the plasma/declarativeimports/plasmacomponents
directory. The components which already there are not yet done, they
lack of tooltips, keyboard events handling, focus policy, and some
(CheckBox and RadioButton) hasn&amp;rsquo;t images yet. However they&amp;rsquo;re fully
functional and they cover all the properties and behaviours defined in
the common API. Here is the list of the components in this state
mentioned above (until this post publication):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;BusyIndicator&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Button&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CheckBox&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RadioButton&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Slider&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are components not present in the common API but they&amp;rsquo;re highly
wanted in plasma:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ScrollBar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ListItem&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ListItemView&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ListHighlight&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To test these components, its also kept a components gallery
(plasma/declarativeimports/test/Gallery.qml) that you may view it with
qmlviewer (after installing the components).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://dakerfp.github.io/img/gallery.png&#34; alt=&#34;Gallery screenshot&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feedback is highly appreciated. ;-)&lt;/p&gt;
