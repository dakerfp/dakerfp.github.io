      <description>Hi,

As it is a powerful way to develop interfaces and it&amp;rsquo;s the future of UI development for Qt was necessary to make the plasma support it.
Create interfaces in QML is really easy and fast but sometimes we need common widgets and may be boring to reimplement and replicate them in every application we create (e.</description>
