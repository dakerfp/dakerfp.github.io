Today I had the honor to make a presentation with Brunno Gommes
([@brunnogomes](http://twitter.com/brunnogomes)) about MongoDB on a
Workshop (actually the second) of Free Software at CIn-UFPE. The
workshop was organized by the University Linux User Group
([CIn-LUG](http://cinlug-br.org/)).

The content of the presentation was to introduce people to MongoDB
basic operations and give a snapshot of the advanced features. To those
who don't know MongoDB I strongly recommend to start to reading the
presentation. Probably I will talk more about it here on the
Codecereal.

Anyway, I'm publishing my presentation here, so enjoy it:
