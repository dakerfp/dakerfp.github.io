I've been away from KDE activities from a time, because I was organizing
a lot of stuff in my life. Happily I've finally arranged some time to
hack more on the weekends. I'll try to keep up the work with the Plasma
Components [documentation](http://api.kde.org/4.x-api/plasma-qml-apidocs/),
because I think it can be improved a lot. I will also try to come up with
a few examples inside the documentation, to make easier for plasmoid
developers.

Another long term goal for this year, which I already started to
investigate, is how to optimizeÂ  Qt Components for more about the Qt QML
Components, beyond Plasma, and I'm already investigating how can we do
proper styling for Qt5.

In another thread, I'm also having a great experience by working with
[Nuno](http://pinheiro-kde.blogspot.com/) in an application for the
[Akademy 2012](http://akademy.kde.org/), at Tallinn, Estonia. The
application it's basically a guide for the event, with essential
information about it. It will also include a programme which will alert
you about the presentations you want to attend to. And it's being such a
great experience to share ideas with him!

Here are some snapshots of the app:
