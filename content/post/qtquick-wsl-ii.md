[QtQuick](http://qt.nokia.com/qtquick/) uses QML, a powerful tool for
creating fluid interfaces in a clean, easy and fast way. It uses a
declarative language (Javascript based) and it has a really good
performance, which makes it suitable to make apps for any kind of
platform. It's also really easy to extend QML with Qt/C++, enbling
developers to speedup the application logic or something else needed. Is
also possible to use OpenGL to render QtQuick without any change in the
code, sending the painting job to the video card. IMHO, it's greatest
advantage, is because suitable for designer who already know HTML and
CSS to build awesome interfaces, being easier than Flash and
ActionScript. This is really welcome because the QtQuick prototypes are
more straightforward, because can be directly integrated in the final
application code.
 
These are some videos showing what can be done with QtQuick:

I've been developing with QtQuick (and some extensions such as the
MeeGo and the [Plasma Components](http://codecereal.blogspot.com/2011/05/plasma-components.html))
for quite a long time (for almost a year from now). So I'm sharing my
QtQuick presentation on the II Workshop of Free Software at CIn-UFPE at
28/03/2011. The workshop was organized by the University Linux User
Group ([CIn-LUG](http://cinlug-br.org/)) with the intent to show new
free technologies and show how to start using them.
