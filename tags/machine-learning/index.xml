      <description>Keras is great for machine learning and describing models! However, sometimes it lacks the flexibility power that Tensorflow has. The great news is that you can interface while using Tensorflow as a backend for Keras.
You may for instance, pre-process your data before feeding into a Keras learning model, to use GPUs capabilities with little programming costs. The following example normalizes the channels of a image before training, then it uses the transformed tensor as input to the model.</description>

      <description>Profinling is the action of summarizing a set of data in a smaller mathematical model. One of the practical usages of profiling techniques is the classification of sequences. With a data set profile, you may calculate the distance of an instance to the model, and classify the instance trough this value.
Profiling proteins is a more specific case of profiling sequences. As we know from the previous post about Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) is a very robust mathematical model to represent probabilistically sequences.</description>
