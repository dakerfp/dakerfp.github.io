      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://pillow.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html&#34;&gt;Pillow&lt;/a&gt; is a
&lt;a href=&#34;http://pythonware.com/products/pil/&#34;&gt;PIL&lt;/a&gt; fork created to add new
features. setuptools support was also added. A more frequent release
cycle was also promised. With Pillow you can have PIL as a package
dependency in setuptools and virtualenv. That means less clutter and
robustness for us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pillow allows you to continue to use &lt;code&gt;import PIL&lt;/code&gt;, so there is no need
to change your current PIL related code. 0 migration overhead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Archlinux already dropped support for PIL in favor of Pillow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR PIL &amp;gt; Pillow&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Protein Profile with HMM</title>
      <link>http://dakerfp.github.io/post/protein_profile_with_hmm/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 07 Jul 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://dakerfp.github.io/post/protein_profile_with_hmm/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Profinling is the action of summarizing a set of data in a smaller mathematical
model. One of the practical usages of profiling techniques is the
classification of sequences. With a data set profile, you may calculate
the distance of an instance to the model, and classify the instance
trough this value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Profiling proteins is a more specific case of profiling sequences. As we
know from the previous post about &lt;a href=&#34;http://codecereal.blogspot.com/2011/05/hidden-markov-models.html&#34;&gt;Hidden Markov
Models&lt;/a&gt;
(HMMs) is a very robust mathematical model to represent
probabilistically sequences. This post will detail how to profile sets
of proteins with a HMM model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The HMM model for this problem must be a HMM which when we calculate a
probability of generation of a protein by the model, must give higher
probabilities for proteins similar for the ones used to create the
profile against the others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To build the model, I&amp;rsquo;ve started with a &lt;a href=&#34;https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Multiple_sequence_alignment&#34;&gt;multiple sequence
alignment&lt;/a&gt;
to see how is the structure of the sequences. That means that our HMM
will be a probabilistic representation of a multiple alignment. With the
alignment we see that some columns are complete and some are almost, and
the others have few data. These most common matches can be used as a
common matches for our model and the deletions and insertions can be
modelled as other states. Here is an example of a few sequences aligned
and the core columns of the alignment (marked with an *):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;AC----ATGTCAACTATCACAC--AGCAGA---ATCACCG--ATC&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this sample of alignment we have examples of insertions and
deletions between the core alignments, which may have a state on the HMM
to represent them. Note that insertions may occur on arbitrary times
between the matching states. And the deletion states always replaces
some matching. One possible HMM template for building the model is
presented in the following picture:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://dakerfp.github.io/img/profile_hmm.png&#34; alt=&#34;HMM protein profile model&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each matching state (M~j~) is related to the matching on the j^th^ core
alignment. The same applies for deletion state (D~j~). The insertion is
slightly different, because it represents the insertions between the
core alignments, that&amp;rsquo;s why it has one extra state, and this enable to
represent states before the first and after the last alignment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our model will be like the one in the picture with the same length as
the core alignments of a multiple alignment for a given set of
sequences. However we should use &lt;a href=&#34;https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Maximum_likelihood&#34;&gt;maximum likelihood&lt;/a&gt;
to estimate the transitions and emission for each state. The easiest way
to count the total emissions/transitions, is to thread each sequence to
be profiled in the model. For each symbol in the aligned sequence you
must check if the symbol is in the core alignment. If it is, then
increment the count of that state to the next match state, otherwise,
you go to the insertion state. If it is a deletion, go to the deletion
state and increment the transition. Finally, to calculate the
probability for the transitions, just divide the count of each
transition and divide it by all the states leaving the same state. It&amp;rsquo;s
important to notice that we have a stopping state, and this is a special
state that has no transitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that is important to initialize the model with pseudo counts at
each possible transitions. Adding this pseudo count, we let our model
less rigid and avoid overfitting to the train set. Otherwise we could
have some zero probabilities for some sequences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To create the emissions probabilities, at each match state, you also
have to count which symbol was emitted and then increment them. To
calculate the probability, just divide it by the total symbols matched
in the threading process.¬†&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The similar process could be done with the insertion. However, the
insertion states are characterized by having a low occurrence rate and
this may lead us directly to a overfitting problem because the number of
emissions must be too small. To avoid this we should use the background
distribution as the emissions probabilities of each insertion state. The
background distribution is the probability of the occurrence of a given
amino acid in the entire protein set. To calculate this, count each
amino acid type for all the train set sequence and then divided by the
total count.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the deletion states, it&amp;rsquo;s important to notice that it is a silent
state. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t emit any symbol at all. To signalize it in ghmm, just
let all the emissions probabilities with 0. Note that the end state is
also a silent state once we have no emission associated to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ALERT&lt;/strong&gt;: the loglikelihood is the only function in the ghmm library which
handles silent states correctly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, the model is ready for use. However we have a problem of
how to classify a new protein sequence. A threshold could be used to
divide the two classes. However, the most common alternative is to use a
null model to compare with it. The null model is a model which aims
represents any protein with similar probability as any other. With this
two models we could take a sequence and compare if it is more similar to
a general definition of a protein or to a specific family. This model
should model a sequence with average size equal to the aligned sequences
being handled, and should emit any kind of symbol at each position. A
common alternative for creating the null model, is using a single
insertion state, which goes to a stopping state with probability of 1
divided by the average length of¬† sequences in the train set. For the
emissions probability, we should use the background distribution,
because this is related to the general amino acid distribution. At the
end, the model should be like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://dakerfp.github.io/img/null_model.png&#34; alt=&#34;Null Model&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For testing the proposed model, I used a set of 100
&lt;a href=&#34;https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Globin&#34;&gt;globin&lt;/a&gt; proteins
from the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/&#34;&gt;NCBI&lt;/a&gt; protein repository as a
train set to build a profile model, and used
&lt;a href=&#34;http://ghmm.sourceforge.net/&#34;&gt;ghmm&lt;/a&gt; to build and test the model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To test if our model corresponds to our expectations, 100 globins
different from the ones in the trains set were used with 1800 other
random proteins with similar length. The loglikelihood function from the
ghmm library to calculate the similarity index. The classification of
the globins versus non globins, was a comparison between the likelihood
of the protein with the globins profile hmm, and the null model. This
test gave us 100% of accuracy! To display this result graph, each
sequence was pointed out in a graph where the horizontal axis displays
the length of the sequence and the vertical the log of globins / null
models likelihood (or globins - null model loglikelihood). The globins
are plotted in red an the others in blue. Proteins over the zero line
are classified as globins, and below means they aren&amp;rsquo;t globins. The
graphs show us a clear distinction between the classes, and that our
model is very precise for this problem.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Optimizing Functions with Python Caching Decorators</title>
      <link>http://dakerfp.github.io/post/optimizing-functions-with-python-caching-decorators/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 11 Jun 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://dakerfp.github.io/post/optimizing-functions-with-python-caching-decorators/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;On these last months I&amp;rsquo;ve been solving some problems (such as some
&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_Markov_model&#34;&gt;HMMs&lt;/a&gt; algorithms)
which the best solutions involves some kind of &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming&#34;&gt;dynamic
programming&lt;/a&gt;. Some of
them are quite simple to implement, but their recursive formulation are
far more intuitive. The problem is that even in functional languages,
the recursive functions aren&amp;rsquo;t well handled unless you some mechanism
like &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail_call&#34;&gt;tail call&lt;/a&gt;, which aren&amp;rsquo;t
intuitive as we would like to. The simplest example that comes in my
mind is the fibonacci function which is usually defined as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;fib(0) = 1 fib(1) = 1 fib(n) = fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we know, almost all the languages compilers and interpreters use the
&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_stack&#34;&gt;call stack&lt;/a&gt; to call the
recursives cases on functions being executed. We can analyze the
following C fibonacci version:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-c&#34;&gt;int fib(n) {
	 if (n == 0 || n == 1)
        return 1;
    else
 ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2);
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is really simple to understand when contrasted with the definition.
But, if we make a trace of the the program (even with a small input
value) we&amp;rsquo;ll have something like the following evaluation order:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-c&#34;&gt;fib(6) = fib(5) + fib(4)
fib(5) = fib(4) + fib(3)
fib(4) = fib(3) + fib(2)
fib(3) = fib(2) + fib(1)
fib(2) = fib(1) + fib(0)
fib(3) = fib(2) + fib(1)
fib(2) = fib(1) + fib(0)
fib(4) = fib(3) + fib(2)
fib(3) = fib(2) + fib(1)
fib(2) = fib(1) + fib(0)
fib(3) = fib(2) + fib(1)
fib(2) = fib(1) + fib(0)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;![Call stack for fib(6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we can see, there is a repetition of the calculation of fib 4 to 1,
many times and is something we can avoid. In fact, the complexity of
this solution has a exponencial computational complexity because for
each n from input we branch it in 2 until it reachs 0 or 1 approximately
n times, leading us into a O($2^n$) complexity. A simple way to avoid it,
is converting into a interactive form:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-c&#34;&gt;int fib(int n) {
 ¬†¬†¬†int current = 1;
¬†¬†¬† int previous = 1;
¬†¬†¬† int i;
¬†¬†¬† for (i = 1; i &amp;lt; n; i++) {
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†  int temp = current; // XXX: nasty
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† current += previous;
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† previous = temp;
¬†¬†  }
¬†¬†¬† return current;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same result is achieved by using
&lt;a href=&#34;https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Tail_call&#34;&gt;tail call&lt;/a&gt;
for functional languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, it obfuscates the intuitive definition given in as the
recursive formulation. But we still have a problem whenever we calculate
fib(n), we have to recalculate it&amp;rsquo;s previous results even if they was
previously calculated. If this function is used many times in our
program it will take a lot of processing re-computing many of the
values. We can avoid this by using the dynamic programming, which keeps
the record of previously calculated results. The drawback of this
technique is the memory usage, which for large entries can become a
bottleneck. However, processing usually is a more rare computer
resource. A C implementation (not the most elegant) for it is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-c&#34;&gt;// XXX: kids, don&#39;t do this at home
int fib_results[10000];
int last_fib;
int fib(int n) {
 ¬†¬†¬†if (n &amp;lt;= last_fib)
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† return fib_results[n];
¬†¬† int current = fib_results[last_fib-1];
¬†¬† int previous = fib_results[last_fib-2];
¬†¬† for (; last_fib &amp;lt; n; last_fib++) {
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† int temp = current;
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† current += previous;
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† fib_results[last_fib] = current;
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† previous = temp;
¬†¬† }
¬†¬† return current;
}

int main()
{
¬†¬†¬† fib_results[0] = 1;
¬†¬†¬† fib_results[1] = 1;
¬†¬†¬† last_fib = 1;

¬†¬†¬† // ... other stuff ...

¬†¬†¬† return 0;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we can see, dynamic programming isn&amp;rsquo;t too hard to implement. On the
other hand, reading a code it&amp;rsquo;s a though task to do unless you are
already familiar with the algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we extract what is dynamic programming fundamental concept, which is
&amp;ldquo;store pre-computed results&amp;rdquo;, we find a regularity in every recursive
function which we can be transformed into a dynamic programming one. One
of the reasons I love python because it&amp;rsquo;s easy to use meta-programming
concepts, and that&amp;rsquo;s what I will use to transform recursive functions
into it&amp;rsquo;s dynamic form in a ridiculous easy way using function
decorators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Function decorators (or annotations in Java) are a form of
meta-programming for functions. It extends functions with some
functionalities, such as debugging, tracing, adding meta-data to the
function, synchronization or
&lt;a href=&#34;https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Memoization&#34;&gt;memoization&lt;/a&gt;
(not memorization) of values, which is a great way of optimizing
recursive functions by caching their results (if you have enough memory
available). One possible implementation of memoitized decorator in
python is the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34;&gt;def cached(function):
 ¬†¬† cache = {}
 ¬†¬† def wrapper(*args):
 ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† if args in cache:
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†   return cache[args]
 ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† else:
            result = function(*args)
¬†           cache[args] = result
¬†           return result 
    return wrapper
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that I&amp;rsquo;m not using kwargs because they&amp;rsquo;re not hashable, such as the
tuple args, and will add a few complexity in the example. See also that
we a have a function that returns another function, which uses a given
one to calculate results and store them in a cache. To cache our fib
function we may use the following code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34;&gt;@cached
def fib(n):
 ¬†¬†¬† if n == 0 or n == 1:
 ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† return 1
     else:
 ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)

# or in a not so clear version:
def normal_fib(n):
 ¬†¬† if n == 0 or n == 1:
 ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† return 1
 ¬†¬† else:
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)

fib = cached(normal_fib)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This technique is really useful to improve your code performance in a
really easy. On the other hand, it isn&amp;rsquo;t the best solution for almost
all the cases. Many times code a dynamic programming method (if
performance is crucial) will be necessary. Is also important to notice
that I didn&amp;rsquo;t used any cache memory management policy, which is
important to economize memory. Most appropriate cache data structures
(such as numpy arrays for integer arguments) also are welcome. The
python 3.2 version added the lru_cache decorator into the functools
module to make this cache mechanism. If you are already using this
version, it&amp;rsquo;s smarter to use it instead of implementing your one. Here
is how it must be used:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34;&gt;# Python &amp;gt; 3.2 import functools
@functools.lru_cached(max_size=500) # uses a fixed size cache to avoid memory usage explosion
def fib(n)
 ¬†¬†¬† ...
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This technique is very useful not only for economize the CPU resources
but also network (such as caching SQL query results), other IO
operations (such as disk reading) and even user interaction input in a
straightforward way.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>CpG Islands (3) - Model Evaluation</title>
      <link>http://dakerfp.github.io/post/cpg-islands-model-evaluation-3/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 05 Jun 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://dakerfp.github.io/post/cpg-islands-model-evaluation-3/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Following the &lt;a href=&#34;http://codecereal.blogspot.com/2011/06/cpg-islands-2.html&#34;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt;
we&amp;rsquo;ve built a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) for the &lt;a href=&#34;http://codecereal.blogspot.com/2011/05/cpg-islands-1.html&#34;&gt;CpG islands problem&lt;/a&gt;, using the training set.
Now we should evaluate if our model is adequate to predict things about CpG islands.
For evaluate we may use a tagged
sequence and see if the HMM we built can predict the islands and what is
it&amp;rsquo;s accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the viterbi path and a tagged sequence (out ouf the training set),
enable us to compare if the estimative given by the model is coherent
with the real data. Using the HMM and the training and test sets of the
last post, we can compare the results using a &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confusion_matrix&#34;&gt;confusion
matrix&lt;/a&gt;. For example, at
the following snippet of the viterbi path paired with the tagged
sequence:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[ ... 0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1, ... ]
[ ... a t t g t c C G A C  ... ]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We may calculate the following confusion matrix:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;+--------------------------------------+ 
| ¬†          |  Island¬†   | Non Island |
+------------+------------+------------+
| Island¬†    |¬†    4¬†     |¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† 0 ¬†   |
+------------+------------+------------+
| Non Island |¬†¬†¬†¬† 1¬†¬†¬†¬†  |      5     |
+------------+------------+------------+
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that the bigger are the main diagonal values, the more accurate our
model is. Making this matrix with the experiment made (using
&lt;a href=&#34;http://codecereal.blogspot.com/2011/06/cpg-islands-2.html&#34;&gt;HMM with maximum likelihood&lt;/a&gt;)
I got the following matrix:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;+--------------------------------------+ 
| ¬†          |  Island¬†   | Non Island |
+------------+------------+------------+
| Island¬†    |¬†  328815   |¬†¬†¬†¬†61411   |
+------------+------------+------------+
| Non Island |¬†¬†1381515 ¬† |   1889819¬† |
+------------+------------+------------+
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We may see that a good amount of islands was correctly predicted (84,26%
of the islands), but 57,76% of the non islands regions was classified as
islands, which is a bad indicator. A experiment with the HMM after
running the Baum Welch was also evaluated. The results was better from
the obtained by the maximum likelihood when predicting islands (96,56%
of accuracy). But also obtained a higher miss rate (70,70%). Here is the
confusion matrix for this HMM:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;+--------------------------------------+ 
| ¬†          |  Island¬†   | Non Island |
+------------+------------+------------+
| Island¬†    |¬†  376839   |    13387   |
+------------+------------+------------+
| Non Island |  2313138¬†¬† |   958196   |
+------------+------------+------------+
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://dakerfp.github.io/img/cpgs_labels.png&#34; alt=&#34;Matching of Real Sequence, Viterbi and Posterior results&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result obtained was not very accurate. It may happened because we
had few data to train and to evaluate our model. We could also build a
HMM with other indicators that identify the CpG islands for model it
better. Remember we simplified the CpG problem to the frequencies of
occurring Cs and Gs, but a better model could also use the CG pairs.
Using a more complicate HMM we could have more than 2 states and then
associate a set of states to the CpG and non CpG islands sites. This
would allow to use better the posterior result to classify the sequence.
But I keep this as future work.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>CpG Islands (2) - Building a Hidden Markov Model</title>
      <link>http://dakerfp.github.io/post/cpg-islands-model-evaluation-2/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 02 Jun 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://dakerfp.github.io/post/cpg-islands-model-evaluation-2/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;By the definition of the CpG islands in the
&lt;a href=&#34;http://codecereal.blogspot.com/2011/05/cpg-islands-1.html&#34;&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt;
and the &lt;a href=&#34;http://codecereal.blogspot.com/2011/05/hidden-markov-models.html&#34;&gt;Hidden Markov Models&lt;/a&gt;
(HMMs) short introduction, we now can model a HMM for finding CpG
islands. We can create a model very similar to the &amp;ldquo;Fair Bet Casino&amp;rdquo;
problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we are in a nucleotide of given DNA sequence there are two
possibilities, that nucleotide belongs to CpG island (lets denote state
S1) or do not (S0). If you analyse a sibling nucleotide it can stay in
the same state or to change with complementary probabilities. We can
view it as this Markov chain:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://dakerfp.github.io/img/cpg.png&#34; alt=&#34;CpG states Markov chain&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the emissions of the states S0 and S1, we may have the associated
probabilities of the emissions of ACGT symbols. However we can&amp;rsquo;t know
for now how much are these probabilities. However if we have a dataset
of sequences with the attached information of where the CpG islands
occurs, we can estimate those parameters. I used these DNA
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cin.ufpe.br/%7Eigcf&#34;&gt;sequences&lt;/a&gt; tagged by biologists (used
&lt;a href=&#34;http://biopython.org/wiki/Main_Page&#34;&gt;biopython&lt;/a&gt; library to parse the
&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTA_format&#34;&gt;.fasta&lt;/a&gt; files) as the
training and test sets to build the model and evaluate the technique.
This dataset consists of nucleotides in upper and lower cases. When we
have a given nucleotide in upper case, it denotes that it is a CpG site
and the lower case nucleotides means they are not. I used a statistical
technique called &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_likelihood&#34;&gt;maximum likelihood&lt;/a&gt;
to build the HMM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the maximum likelihood to calculate the HMM emissions
probabilities, I count each char frequency in the dataset and divide by
the total amount of nucleotides in the same state:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://dakerfp.github.io/img/cpgemissions.png&#34; alt=&#34;Emissions probability diagram&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;P(A|S0) = a / (a+c+g+t) P(C|S0) = c / (a+c+g+t)
P(G|S0) = g / (a+c+g+t) P(T|S0) = t / (a+c+g+t)
P(A|S1) = A / (A+C+G+T) P(C|S1) = C / (A+C+G+T)
P(G|S1) = G / (A+C+G+T) P(T|S1) = T / (A+C+G+T)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And to calculate the transition probabilities of each state, count the
number of transitions between a CpG to a non CpG site ``(out_of) and
the reversal transitions (into). Then divide each of them by the state
frequency which they&amp;rsquo;re coming from. Note that the permanence
probability of each state is the complement of the probability of
transiting between states since there is no other state to go:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;P(S0|S1) = out_of / (A+C+G+T)
P(S1|S0) = into / (a+c+g+t)
P(S0|S0) = 1 - P(S1|S0)
P(S1|S1) = 1 - P(S0|S1)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our model is almost done, it just lacks of the initial transitions which
can be supposed to be the frequency of each state over all nucleotides:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;P(S0) = a + c + g + t / (a + c + g + t + A + C + G + T)
P(S1) = A + C + G + T / (a + c + g + t + A + C + G + T)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used the &lt;a href=&#34;http://ghmm.org/&#34;&gt;ghmm&lt;/a&gt; to create my HMM with the given
dataset and it generated this model:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;DiscreteEmissionHMM(N=2, M=4)
	state 0 (initial=0.97)
 ¬†¬†¬†   Emissions: 0.30, 0.21, 0.20, 0.29
   ¬†¬†¬† Transitions: -&amp;gt;0 (0.00), -&amp;gt;1 (1.00)
 ¬† state 1 (initial=0.03)
 ¬†  ¬†¬† Emissions: 0.22, 0.29, 0.29, 0.20
   ¬†¬†¬† Transitions: -&amp;gt;0 (1.00), -&amp;gt;1 (0.00)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s important to notice that when we print the HMM it says that has the
probability of 1 to stay in the same state. This occurs due to float
formatted print. The reality is that in that value is very close to 1
but still has a chance to hop between states. It&amp;rsquo;s also interesting to
see the probability of emission of C and G when we contrast the states.
In S1 the probability of getting a C or a G is significantly higher than
in S0.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another manner of creating the HMM, is by initializing a model with the
same structure we modelled the problem and then apply some unsupervised
learning algorithms, such as the
&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baum%E2%80%93Welch_algorithm&#34;&gt;Baum Welch&lt;/a&gt;
algorithm. The Baum Welch uses randomized initial weights in the HMM and
once you feed untagged sequences, it tries to infer a model. However,
usually is far better initialize your HMM with biased data about the
problem (for example using the model we created) and let the Baum Welch
calibrate the probabilities. With ghmm do the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;sigma = ghmm.IntegerRange(0,4) # our emission alphabet
emission_seq = ghmm.EmissionSequence(sigma, [0, 4, 5, ... ]) # create a emission sequence hmm.
baumWelch(sigma, emission_seq) # use a template hmm to calibrate the probablities
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the next post I will show how is the evaluation process of the HMM
in the CpG island.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Hidden Markov Models</title>
      <link>http://dakerfp.github.io/post/hidden-markov-models/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 30 May 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://dakerfp.github.io/post/hidden-markov-models/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, many applications use
&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_Markov_model&#34;&gt;Hidden Markov Models&lt;/a&gt;
(HMMs) to solve crucial issues such as bioinformatics, speech recognition,
musical analysis, digital signal processing, data mining, financial
applications, time series analysis and many others. HMMs are
probabilistic models which are very useful to model sequence behaviours
or discrete time series events. Formally it models
&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_process&#34;&gt;Markov processes&lt;/a&gt;
with hidden states, like an extension for
&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain&#34;&gt;Markov Chains&lt;/a&gt;.
For computer scientists, is a state machine with probabilistic transitions
where each state can emit a value with a given probability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For better understanding HMMs, I will illustrate how it works with &amp;ldquo;The
Fair Bet Casino&amp;rdquo; problem. Imagine you are in a casino where you can bet
on coins tosses, tossed by a dealer. A coin toss can have two outcomes:
head (H) or tail (T). Now suppose that the coin dealer has two coins, a
fair (F) which outputs both H and T with &lt;code&gt;1/2&lt;/code&gt; probabilities and a biased
coin (B) which outputs H with probability &lt;code&gt;3/4&lt;/code&gt; and T with &lt;code&gt;1/4&lt;/code&gt;. Using
probability language we say:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;P(H~i+1~|F~i~) = 1/2&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;P(T~i+1~|F~i~) = 1/2&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;P(H~i+1~|B~i~) = 3/4&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;P(T~i+1~|B~i~) = 1/4&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now imagine that the dealer changes the coin in a way you can&amp;rsquo;t see, but
you know that he does it with a &lt;code&gt;1/10&lt;/code&gt; probability. So thinking the coin
tosses as a sequence of events we can say:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;P(F~i+1~|F~i~) = 9/10&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;P(B~i+1~|F~i~) = 1/10&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;P(B~i+1~|B~i~) = 9/10&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;P(F~i+1~|B~i~) = 1/10&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can model it using a graph to illustrate the process:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://dakerfp.github.io/img/fairbet.png&#34; alt=&#34;HMM for &amp;quot;The Fair Bet Casino&amp;quot; problem&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s a HMM! It isn&amp;rsquo;t any rocket science. Is just important to add a
few remarks. We call the set of all possible emissions of the Markov
process as the alphabet Œ£ ({H, T} in our problem). For many of
computational method involving HMMs you will also need a initial state
distribution œÄ. For our problem we may assume that the we have equal
probability for each coin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now comes in our mind what we can do with the model in our hands. There
are lot&amp;rsquo;s of stuff to do with it, such as: given a sequence of results,
when the dealer used the biased coin or even generate a random sequence
with a coherent behaviour when compared to the model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a nice library called &lt;a href=&#34;http://ghmm.org/&#34;&gt;ghmm&lt;/a&gt;
(available for C and Python) which handles HMMs and already gives us
the most famous and important HMM algorithms.
Unfortunately the python wrapper is not pythonic.
Let&amp;rsquo;s model our problem in python to have some fun:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;import ghmm 

# setting 0 for Heads and 1 for Tails as our Alphabet
sigma = ghmm.IntegerRange(0, 2)

# transition matrix: rows and columns means origin and destiny states
transitions_probabilities = [
    [0.9, 0.1], # 0: fair state
 ¬†¬†¬† [0.1, 0.9], # 1: biased state
]  

# emission matrix: rows and columns means states and symbols respectively 
emissions_probabilities = [
¬†¬†¬† [0.5, 0.5], # 0: fair state emissions probabilities
 ¬†¬† [0.75, 0.25], # 1: biased state emissions probabilities
]

# probability of initial states
pi = [0.5, 0.5]

# equal probabilities for 0 and 1
hmm = ghmm.HMMFromMatrices(
¬†¬†¬† sigma,
¬†¬†¬† # you can model HMMs with others emission probability distributions
    ghmm.DiscreteDistribution(sigma),
    transitions_probabilities,
¬†¬†¬† emissions_probabilities,
    pi )


&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print(hmm)`\
  DiscreteEmissionHMM(N=2, M=2)
 ¬†    state 0 (initial=0.50)
 ¬†¬†     ¬† Emissions: 0.50, 0.50
    ¬†¬†  ¬† Transitions: -&amp;gt;0 (0.90), -&amp;gt;1 (0.10)
    ¬† state 1 (initial=0.50)
      ¬†¬†¬† Emissions: 0.75, 0.25
      ¬†¬†¬† Transitions: -&amp;gt;0 (0.10), -&amp;gt;1 (0.90)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we have our HMM object on the hand we can play with it. Suppose
you have the given sequence of coin tosses and you would like to
distinguish which coin was being used at a given state:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;tosses = [1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1,
          1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0,
          0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1,
          0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0,
          0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0,
          1, 0, 1]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viterbi_algorithm&#34;&gt;viterbi algorithm&lt;/a&gt;
can be used to trace the most probable states at each coin toss
according to the HMM distribution:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;# not as pythonic is could be :-/
sequence = ghmm.EmissionSequence(sigma, tosses)
viterbi_path, _ = hmm.viterbi(sequence)
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print(viterbi_path)
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, , 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nice! But sometimes is interesting to have the probability of each state
on the point instead of only the most probable one. To have that, you
must use the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_mode&#34;&gt;posterior&lt;/a&gt; or
&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_algorithm&#34;&gt;forward&lt;/a&gt; algorithms to
have more detailed information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;states_probabilities = hmm.posterior(sequence)
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print(states_probabilities)
 [[0.8407944139086141, 0.1592055860913865], [0.860787703168127, 0.13921229683187356], ... ]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The posterior method result, returns the list of probabilities at each
state, for example, in the first index we have &lt;code&gt;[0.8407944139086141, 0.1592055860913865]&lt;/code&gt;.
That means that we have ~0.84 probability of chance that the dealer is
using the fair coin and ~0.16 for the biased coin.
We also can plot a graph to show the behaviour of the curve of
the probability of the dealer being using the fair coin
(I used matplotlib for the graphs).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://dakerfp.github.io/img/viterbi.png&#34; alt=&#34;Probability of being a fair coin over time&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is only a superficial example of what can HMMs do. It&amp;rsquo;s worthy give
a look at it if you want do some sequence or time series analysis in any
domain. I hope this post presented and cleared what are HMM and how they
can be used to analyse data.&lt;/p&gt;
