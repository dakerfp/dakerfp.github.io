      <description>Pillow is a PIL fork created to add new features. setuptools support was also added. A more frequent release cycle was also promised. With Pillow you can have PIL as a package dependency in setuptools and virtualenv. That means less clutter and robustness for us.
Pillow allows you to continue to use import PIL, so there is no need to change your current PIL related code. 0 migration overhead.
Archlinux already dropped support for PIL in favor of Pillow.</description>
