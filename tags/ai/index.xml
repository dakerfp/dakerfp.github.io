      <description>Following the post we&amp;rsquo;ve built a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) for the CpG islands problem, using the training set. Now we should evaluate if our model is adequate to predict things about CpG islands. For evaluate we may use a tagged sequence and see if the HMM we built can predict the islands and what is it&amp;rsquo;s accuracy.
Using the viterbi path and a tagged sequence (out ouf the training set), enable us to compare if the estimative given by the model is coherent with the real data.</description>

      <title>CpG Islands (2) - Building a Hidden Markov Model</title>

      <description>By the definition of the CpG islands in the previous post and the Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) short introduction, we now can model a HMM for finding CpG islands. We can create a model very similar to the &amp;ldquo;Fair Bet Casino&amp;rdquo; problem.
When we are in a nucleotide of given DNA sequence there are two possibilities, that nucleotide belongs to CpG island (lets denote state S1) or do not (S0). If you analyse a sibling nucleotide it can stay in the same state or to change with complementary probabilities.</description>

      <description>Nowadays, many applications use Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) to solve crucial issues such as bioinformatics, speech recognition, musical analysis, digital signal processing, data mining, financial applications, time series analysis and many others. HMMs are probabilistic models which are very useful to model sequence behaviours or discrete time series events. Formally it models Markov processes with hidden states, like an extension for Markov Chains. For computer scientists, is a state machine with probabilistic transitions where each state can emit a value with a given probability.</description>
