      <description>ePassport is the name given for the new passport specification standardized by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). It was created to speed up and standardize the immigration procedures. This standard specifies RFID as the communication channel between the passport and the reader. The main feature present on it is the insertion of biometric data into the passport for biometric checks, including facial recognition, fingerprint and iris information. To keep this important data protected, an interesting cryptographic layer was added in addition to the usual document falsification mechanisms such as watermarks.</description>
